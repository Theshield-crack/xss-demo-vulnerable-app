# XSS Demo: Vulnerable Java Web App + Credential Capture (Educational Lab)

This project demonstrates how **DOM-based and reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerabilities can be chained together to simulate a **phishing attack** using a vulnerable Java Spring web application and a credential-capturing PHP backend.
